# space_missions_visualizations
Data Visualization group project on the theme of space as part of the UCL MSIN0167 Data Visualization course.

The theme of space was chosen and its different aspects were explored and visualized: space missions history and information, budget spending, gender parity, space tourism and more.

A web page has also been created for this project, using HTML, CSS and Javascript languages. The visualizations include several static ones displayed like an infographic and a final dynamic visualization.
